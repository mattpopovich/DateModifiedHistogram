# DateModifiedHistogram
Displays a 24hr histogram based on when the files in the folder selected were modified. Made this for my dad so that he can analyze when there is activity on his trailcam ðŸ˜‚

# Create an executable to be used on Windows: 
My dad doesn't know anyting about Python, let alone computers. Let's make an executable for him to easily use. 

First, install pyinstaller -  `pip install pyinstaller`, then run
```
$ cd DateModifiedHistogram
$ pyinstaller DateModifiedHistogram.py --onefile
```
This will generate `DateModifiedHistogram.exe` in the `dist` folder that gets created (if ran in Windows, not sure what happens if you run `pyinstaller` on Linux/Mac).
